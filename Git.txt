1)git init -->intitialize the repository in the current folder
  
   you can see hidden folder .git where git store everything including change sets,branches and so on.At any time you can
delete this folder to delete the repository

eg:
----
user@user-PC MINGW64 /e/Workspace_Hub/gitDemo
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in E:/Workspace_Hub/gitDemo/.git/



2)git status -->to track the files whether there are any new files or changes in the existing files


Eg:
---
   $ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        Commands.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


---
The above is telling Command.txt is untracked


3)Lets fix this by   "git add Commands.txt"

then type the below command 

  git status

Eg:
---

user@user-PC MINGW64 /e/Workspace_Hub/gitDemo (master)
$ git add Commands.txt

user@user-PC MINGW64 /e/Workspace_Hub/gitDemo (master)
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   Commands.txt

-----

Now the file is ready to commit and this is called staging

Now if you change content in the file and type git status
and you will see both tracked and untracked for commands.txt
but why?

git had only statged file which is at that time i.e tracked and untracked for the latest added change i.e untracked and 
now if you commit it will not contain latest change ,in order to have recent change "git add Commands.txt"

i.e when ever something changes we need to stage that file so that changes will be reflected when they are comitted 



-------------------------------------------------Start of Setting up Git repository-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up a repository in git Hub
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Global setup[tells who has commited the change]

git config --global user.name "Mantena Phanindra venkata Varma"
git config --global user.email varma19.manthena@gmail.com

2)Now i want to create local repository for my project and commit to git
go to the folder-->E:\Workspace_Hub\React_POC\react_js_assignment and right click git bash

Then do the below init,stage and commit
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-->Now the code has been moved to local repository


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The below command will map remote repository at <remote_repo_url> to a ref in your local repo under <remote_name>.
 Once you have mapped the remote repo you can push local branches to it.

git remote add <remote_name> <remote_repo_url>

origin is the branch that i have on my local
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


user@user-PC MINGW64 /e/Workspace_Hub/React_POC/react_js_assignment (master)
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/varma369/React.js_POC_1.git



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The below command pushes the code from local to remote here master is the default branch creeated in github which is remote
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
user@user-PC MINGW64 /e/Workspace_Hub/React_POC/react_js_assignment (master)
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/varma369/React.js_POC_1.git

user@user-PC MINGW64 /e/Workspace_Hub/React_POC/react_js_assignment (master)
